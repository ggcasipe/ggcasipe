First of all, the crippling debt of the Philippines. Currently, the Philippines has the lowest currency value in the ASEAN which is just sad. Not only that but the Philippines is a 3rd world country. To bump up our economy, we would need to increase the growth of our money. Everybody must be working hard to solve that which leads to our solution. <br>

We exploit the poor to work really hard for us. This idea came from the use of slaves by the Europeans to fuel their tabacco farms and back then Europe became rich because of this. We could exploit the land reforms and give false hope to the poor. Although this could lead to overwork and many deaths, these deaths can also help solve the Philippinesâ€™ overpopulation which is a win-win.

An editorial cartoon about silencing the press.<br> <br>
To solve the revolts and protests against this, we could implement martial law and silence the media which leads to less overpopulation. If we look at China, we could see that this type of media silencing is helpful. Some people may die but that would be for the good of the country which, in my opinion, is heroic enough. Overall, I think that making these types of strict work adjustments can be great in increasing our economy quickly and in decreasing overpopulation.
