Lastly, the high rates of crime. To solve the high crime rates, we need to enforce laws. If martial law is implemented, the criminals will be killed which decreases overpopulation.

Although if we used these criminals as slaves, we can help increase the economy. We can also use the criminals to fuel a type of entertainment which involves killing each other similar to the hunger games.

Drugs are popular and to punish these drug users, we can give them more drugs. Medical prototype drugs can be tested on them to show effectivity thus increasing medical information. With the amount of prisoners in prisons such as Bilibid prison, we have a lot of criminals to work with. In conclusion, we can use these prisoners for the Philippines’ benefit which effectively brings more pressure to maintain peace and gives more use to the outcasts of society.<br>

	So, in conclusion, these solutions each solve atleast one of the Philippines’ problems each. Although they aren’t ethical and are flawed, I still think they are better than nothing. For now, we must hope everything gets better after the pandemic. But aside everything, thank you viewer for reading my webpage, do you think the adoption method is a good idea? The rest is up to you a citizen who has the right to have his/her own opinion.
