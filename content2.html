Secondly, the problems with the government and their corruption. The government has been doing poorly for a long time and we can prove that by just looking at the news. One of the recent projects of the government which involved putting dolomite in the Manila bay just to make it look like a white sand beach. This costed 28 million pesos according to the government which could be used for better things like actually cleaning Manila bay, not only that but it is also dangerous to marine life causing more problems.

This incompetence can be solved with the “adoption method.” The “adoption method” is another solution I drew inspiration from the Spanish conquest. This method works by letting the Philippines be governed by another country in replace of the government that many people are against. Back when we were governed by the Americans, the Philippine peso was worth about half an American dollar. Personally, I think the two best options of countries to be adopted by are China and the USA. Our president is already loyal to both countries which makes things easier to handle. China would be great as it makes use of great dictatorship and has more silenced media. It is said that China also has close to 200 million CCTV cameras around the country which greatly lessens crime rate for the masses <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/dec/02/big-brother-is-watching-chinese-city-with-26m-cameras-is-worlds-most-heavily-surveilled">(more on this here)</a>.
As for USA, it would be great to have a share of their economy. They also provide more educational services which helps in increasing the average Filipino iq of 86. In conclusion, I think freedom is unnecessary and the adoption method helps in converting that freedom for success.
